Person 1 - HR Manager
"For our next training session, let’s approach it from a high-level perspective to make it more impactful."

Person 2 - HR Specialist
"Could you clarify what you mean by high-level? Should we skip the detailed sections and focus on the key points?"

Person 1 - HR Manager
"Yes, keep it simple. We don’t want to overwhelm attendees with too much information."

Person 3 - Training Coordinator, HR Department
"Does that mean I should skip the case studies and just stick to basics?"

Person 1 - HR Manager
"No, don’t skip them entirely! Just… you know, keep it high level."

Person 2 - HR Specialist
"I’m still unclear. Should we reduce the examples or keep everything but in a condensed form?"

Person 1 - HR Manager
"Just make it engaging without going too deep. We can add details in follow-up sessions."
