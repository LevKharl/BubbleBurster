Person 1 - Sales Director
"We need the sales pitch deck updated ASAP. The client expects something modern and dynamic."

Person 2 - Sales Rep
"I’m on it, but could you specify what they’re looking for? Are there specific elements they want changed?"

Person 1 - Sales Director
"They just want it to feel fresh. Can you work your magic?"

Person 3 - Marketing Coordinator
"Should we be updating the messaging too, or just the visuals? I thought they liked the current pitch."

Person 1 - Sales Director
"Just tweak it. It doesn’t have to be a full redesign, but make it more engaging."

Person 2 - Sales Rep
"‘Fresh’ and ‘engaging’ are a bit vague. Should I make it more visual, add more data, or focus on storytelling?"
