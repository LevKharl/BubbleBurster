HR Manager
"We’re rolling out a new employee recognition program. This will boost morale, but I want it to feel personal and impactful."

HR Specialist
"Sounds good! Should we set up guidelines on how often recognition should be given, or leave it open-ended?"

HR Manager
"Let’s keep it flexible, but I want everyone to feel noticed."

Training Coordinator
"Are we thinking of doing shoutouts in the team meetings, or is it more about individual emails?"

HR Manager
"Maybe a bit of both. I trust you to make it meaningful."

HR Specialist
"It would be helpful to have a framework. Are we recognizing just achievements, or also small daily contributions?"

HR Manager
"Let’s just make sure everyone feels valued. We’ll adjust as we go."
