Project Manager
"We need to increase our social media engagement, so let's prioritize creating new content this month. It’s our main focus."

Content Strategist
"Got it. Should we shift resources from the blog to social media, then?"

Project Manager
"Yes, but don’t neglect the blog entirely. Both need to perform well."

Graphic Designer
"Do we need to create new visuals specifically for social media, or are we repurposing existing content?"

Project Manager
"Both. Just make sure everything is fresh and engaging."

Content Strategist
"That’s a bit conflicting—if both are high priority, it’ll be hard to focus effectively. Should we set specific engagement goals for social media first?"

Project Manager
"Just keep a balance. I trust you all to figure it out."
