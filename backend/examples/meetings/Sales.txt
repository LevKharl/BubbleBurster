Sales Director
"Alright team, this quarter, we need to increase our close rates by 20%. Focus on high-value clients."

Sales Rep
"Does that mean we’re focusing on existing clients, or should we also be reaching out to new prospects?"

Sales Director
"Both. Just make sure you’re pushing to hit that close rate goal."

Account Manager
"Are we prioritizing follow-ups with current clients, or should we be focusing on expanding outreach?"

Sales Director
"Honestly, it’s all important. I trust you to figure out the best approach."

Sales Rep
"That’s hard to balance without specifics. Should we have separate goals for new and existing clients?"

Sales Director
"Just focus on closing deals, wherever they come from."
