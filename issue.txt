hello. I am working already for 1 year here and I have been told I am going to be promoted but it doesn't happen and also I am overworking so please help me
yesterday someone harrassed me in the bathroom when i was on second floor. i am too ashamed to say to say anything to my manager so i just put it here instead...
I feel like my skills in data analysis are going underutilized. I’m often assigned basic tasks that don’t challenge me or help me grow in my role.
The workload has been overwhelming, especially with recent deadlines. I barely have time to finish my tasks, let alone take a break
The hours are very demanding, and I’ve struggled to balance work with personal commitments. Some flexibility with scheduling would be helpful
I  wish I had more input in how my role is structured. Sometimes, tasks feel random and lack relevance to my professional development
The atmosphere here feels quite negative. People rarely communicate openly, and it feels like everyone is keeping to themselves.
The office environment feels unsafe, particularly with outdated equipment. There’s a constant worry about potential hazards.
I feel unsupported by my colleagues. When I reach out for help or guidance, it’s often met with silence or reluctance to assist
I’ve noticed some bullying behavior in my department. It’s disheartening, and I think it impacts the overall morale of our team
There’s a lack of diversity in our meetings, and I sometimes feel my ideas are dismissed. It would be nice if there was more inclusion in decision-making
I’ve been doing the work of a senior employee but without the title or compensation. It feels like my efforts aren’t being recognized
The recent restructuring has left me feeling uncertain about my job security. I wish there were more transparent communication on this
Balancing home and work life has been challenging, especially with the lack of remote options. Flexibility would be greatly appreciated
I appreciate the support I’ve received from my team lead in developing my skills. The training sessions have been incredibly beneficial
The recent improvements in our workspace have made a huge difference. It feels more comfortable and conducive to productivity
